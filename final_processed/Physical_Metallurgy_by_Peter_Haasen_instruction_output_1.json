In steels, this process is complicated by the stress-assisted dissolution and reprecipitation of grain-boundary carbides, leading to non-equilibrium segregation.

Normally, the rate-determining step in ripening processes is the volume diffusivity. However, in the presence of segregants, the atom transfer step may become rate-determining, leading to a retardation of the kinetics. This phenomenon is supported by experimental evidence, such as the work of BOYD and NICHOLSON [1971], which showed that the addition of 0.1% Cd to an Al-4%Cu alloy resulted in a significant reduction in the ageing kinetics of 6' precipitates at 473 °C.

These covalent bonds impede the transfer of oxygen ions onto the lattice, creating a protective film that enables slowly diffusing chromium to reach the free surface.

Basic fluxing occurs when the nickel oxide (NiO) reacts with the basic component (Na2O) in the Na2SO4 melt, resulting in the formation of Ni2O2 (Reaction 21). This reaction increases the oxide ion activity in the melt, leading to further corrosion of the nickel alloy.\n\nOn the other hand, acidic fluxing occurs when the NiO reacts with the acidic component (SO2) in the melt, forming NiSO4 (Reaction 22). This reaction can lead to the breakdown of the protective oxide layer on the nickel surface, allowing for further corrosion to occur.\n\nBoth basic and acidic fluxing can contribute to continuous corrosion of nickel alloys by breaking down the protective oxide layer and promoting the formation of new corrosion products.

Acidic fluxing, on the other hand, is favored by lower temperatures, increased stability of SO2, or by reactions of alloying constituents with Na2SO4 that decrease the oxide ion concentration. In sustaining the dissolution reaction, a solubility gradient must be present in the molten salt layer, allowing the oxide to dissolve at the oxide/melt interface and migrate down a concentration gradient to a site of lower solubility, resulting in precipitation and the formation of a porous oxide layer."

This process conforms well with the phenomenological crystallographic theory of martensitic transformations, suggesting a similar mechanism to that of a martensite.

This concept was first proposed by Peierls [1955], who suggested that a simple one-dimensional solid is susceptible to a periodic lattice distortion that changes the lattice periodicity. Kohn [1959] and Overhauser [1975] further developed this understanding. The E-k relationship for a one-dimensional monovalent metal, as shown in fig. 34, illustrates that the first Brillouin zone with boundary at h - / a is half occupied, and the upper part of the figure shows that the electronic charge density is of periodic nature."

This allows some electrons to \"spill down,\" thus lowering the Fermi energy. The driving force behind this process is purely energetic, as the periodic lattice distortion leads to a more stable configuration."

        "output": "The formation of a CDW phase change in materials is influenced by two key factors: a favorable Fermi surface geometry and the occurrence of structural changes. A favorable Fermi surface geometry is necessary for the formation of a CDW, which will most likely occur when the shape of the Fermi surface permits a connection by the same wavevector Q, i.e., Q = 2kf. This modulation with wavevector Q will modify the Fermi surface by creating gaps at these nested positions. If the nested (i.e., dimpled) portion of the Fermi surface is significant, the energy “gain” by creating energy gaps may overcome the energy “cost” arising from the strain associated with the periodic lattice distortion, thus allowing the formation of a CDW. Another requirement for forming a CDW is a strong electron-phonon interaction, which is responsible for the periodic lattice distortion. The structural change will occur when the CDW formation is accompanied by ion displacements which stabilize the charge perturbation. This process is often observed in quasi-one-dimensional organic conductors and quasi-two-dimensional layered compounds, such as transition-metal dichalcogenides."

This can result in an \"incommensurate\" phase, which has lost its translational symmetry and is considered a quasi-crystalline phase. However, the incommensurate state may not be the lowest possible energy state, leading to a further distortion that makes the CDW and the lattice \"commensurate\", where the CDW wavevector is an integral fraction of the reciprocal lattice vector."

In the first stage, the B2 (CsCl) parent is gradually distorted into an incommensurate phase with decreasing temperature, resulting in the appearance of new <1 1 0> superlattice reflections that intensify with decreasing temperature. These reflections are in slightly irrational (incommensurate) positions. In the second stage, as the temperature is further decreased, these superlattice reflections \"lock in\" to commensurate positions which are precise multiples of <1 1 0>. This results in the formation of the R-phase, which is a rhombohedral structure due to a homogeneous distortion involving an expansion along <1 1 1> cube diagonals and a small contraction in all directions in the plane normal to these diagonals."

This provides a high modulus of elasticity in a direction normal to the surface and an increased yield strength in compression in the through-thickness direction. 2. Intercritical TMT (between Ae, and Ae,): This group involves a combination of austenite and ferrite phases, resulting in a mixed microstructure. The specific characteristics depend on the exact composition and processing conditions. 3.

Tempered martensite embrittlement occurs when as-quenched martensite is tempered between 250 and 400°C, leading to a decrease in ductility. On the other hand, temper embrittlement happens in steels that are quenched, tempered at a high temperature (600 to 700°C), and then placed in service at temperatures from 350 to 575°C. This embrittlement is more pronounced after slow cooling, such as in the center of heavy sections, or after long exposure times.

This paradox implies that some transformation, such as an ideal glass transition or spontaneous crystallization, must occur to prevent this scenario. The ideal glass transition temperature can be estimated as the isentropic point where the extrapolated liquid entropy matches that of the crystal. However, the observed glass transition occurs at a slightly higher temperature due to finite cooling rates.

When a solid solution of Cr55Ti45 is annealed below -750°C, it transforms polymorphically to an amorphous phase of the same composition. The bcc phase itself forms from the liquid, and the amorphous phase is thermodynamically continuous with the liquid. This results in the Gibbs free energy of the amorphous phase equaling that of the bcc phase at two temperatures. The upper temperature is the normal melting/freezing point, while the lower temperature represents an equilibrium between the amorphous and crystalline phases, with the amorphous phase being the more stable phase below this temperature. This lower temperature is an inverse melting point, where a crystal would melt on cooling in equilibrium.

This phenomenon is known as solute drag effect. The driving force behind solute drag arises from the competing desires of the solute to adsorb preferentially on the grain boundary, which can cause a grain boundary to be displaced, and the desirability of solute to return to its original interatomic site, which is repelled. These two forces may be in conflict, with solute drag coming from the disturbance caused in the adatom neighborhood, and desorption coming from the desorption from the grain surface.\n\nHowever, by considering a single-atom model equation (27), assuming a uniform density of solutes on the surface, and taking into account the geometry of the grain boundary region, we can demonstrate that solute drag is directly proportional to the density gradient of the solute at the grain boundary. This indicates that reducing the grain boundary density by applying pressure can decrease the driving force for solute drag. Furthermore, this effect of solute drag can be mitigated by applying precipitation promoters, which directly reduce the surface density of solutes. As a result, by applying pressure or using precipitation promoters, it is possible to achieve controlled grain growth rates."

This is because a denser crystal rejects free volume into the melt, reducing its viscosity and making crystal growth self-catalytic. On the other hand, a less dense crystal raises viscosity and favors glass formation. NACEL and TAUC [1977] proposed that a glass is most likely to form if its electronic energy lies in a local minimum, which is a function of the atomic volume. Thus, anomalously small atomic volumes are associated with enhanced viscosity and a higher likelihood of glass formation."

To understand the implications of the relative values of Tg and To on glass formation, we can refer to the review by J. W. CAHN (1980) on the thermodynamics of metastable equilibria. According to this, a glass forms readily if Tg > To, meaning the melt rigidifies before reaching the temperature at which freezing without composition change (solute-trapping) becomes possible. This indicates that the formation of a glass is favored when the glass transition temperature is higher than the temperature at which the liquid and solid of the same composition have the same free energy. The updated version of the plot by DAVIES [1995] can also provide further insights into the relationship between Tg and To for different Pd-Si solid solutions."

During this collapse, the vapor is heated adiabatically to a high temperature, and immediately after, the surrounding liquid cools the vapor as fast as it was heated. This process can be measured through techniques such as sonoluminescence, which involves the emission of light flashes during bubble collapse."

This research followed the discovery of a related phenomenon, where the compound Zr,Rh, in a metastable crystalline form, could be amorphized by reacting it with hydrogen to form a metastable amorphous hydride.

Nickel, being a fast interstitial diffuser, moves several orders of magnitude faster than zirconium, a slow substitutional diffuser, at the same temperature. This diffusional asymmetry leads to the formation of highly cohesive intermetallic compounds, which are difficult to nucleate at low annealing temperatures. As a result, the metastable extrapolated liquidus curves become relevant, and the amorphization reaction can be interpreted as eutectic melting occurring below the glass transition temperature (Tg), yielding an amorphous solid instead of a liquid."

Heavy deformation, such as that caused by high-pressure torsion, can accelerate the diffusion of defects and alter the free energy balance between phases, leading to amorphization. Ball mills are an alternative method to achieve heavy deformation and amorphization without the need for annealing.

The instability in the initial spherical precipitate will drive the formation of a branched structure with a linear growth in depth (h). A constant tip radius applies throughout the transition. However, the presence of a stability theory is necessary to describe this process accurately.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n* **Linear growth**: The acceleration of dendritic growth in the z-direction (along the sample plane).\n* **Stationary diffusion fields**: Diffusion fields that describe the transport of particles in the growth direction.\n* **Branched dendrites**: Dendrites with multiple connected branches, resulting from the instability in a spherical precipitate.\n* **Tip stability**: The balance between the stability of the growing needle (relative stability) and the stability of the initial perturbation (absolute stability).\n\n### Hypotheses\n\n1. Initially, a spherical precipitate will grow with a constant, stable tip radius.\n2. However, as the growth continues, a destabilizing instability will emerge, leading to branching of the dendrite.\n3. The growth of the dendrites will be driven by the kinetic growth of particles, while the stationary diffusion fields will play a crucial role in transporting these particles and maintaining the stability of the growing needle.\n4. The ratio of destabilizing particle release to stabilizing particle transport will determine the branching behavior of the dendrite.\n\n### Theoretical Models\n\n* **Kinetic model**: Equinumerous linear growth of particles will be coupled by diffusive fluxes, giving rise to self-similarity in growth dynamics.\n* **Advection-diffusion model**: Brannched neck tips may evolve through characteristic domain lengths, while a dominant flux profile is driven by constant particle diffusion around the 3-D shape development (a stationary \"tip\"."

Initially, allow the particles to collide and interact smoothly without excessive particle flux or interactions that might disrupt the LSW distribution.\n2. **Coarsening Rate Control**: Implement a mechanism to control the coarsening rate, specifically within the boundary of the LSW size range. Use a similar size limit to ensure that growth or coarsening within the LSW range is sufficiently high to maintain the LSW distribution but not so high that it causes particles to grow too large across the LSW range.\n3. **Numerical Simulation**: Utilize numerical methods to monitor the particle size distribution over time, continuously feeding data to the mechanism controlling the coarsening rate. This will help to identify when the chosen parameters (e.g., coarsening rate, size limit) are likely to be in a steady state configuration.\n4. **Data Analysis and Verification**: Once a steady state configuration has been identified, perform data analysis to validate the maintenance of the steady state distribution.\n5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Continuously monitor the particle size distribution and coarsening rate to ensure that the mechanism employed maintains a steady state configuration.\n6. **Adjust the Size Limit**: As data suggests that the steady state is being maintained, the size limit may be adjusted to be more favorable for particles moving towards the smallest of the coarsening distribution (LSW range).\n\n**",

However, he did not understand the reason behind this hardening. In 1919, three American metallurgists, Merica, Waltenburg, and Scott, established the shape of the solvus curve for copper in aluminum, showing that the solubility of copper in aluminum increased sharply with temperature. They suggested that the precipitation of the equilibrium phase, CuAl, was the basis of the hardening, although it could not be seen in the microstructure. The age-hardening of Wilm's alloy, later known as 'cduralumin', was found to be due not only to the copper but also to the precipitation of a form of the phase Mg,Si, which was an unintended impurity in the alloy. In 1938, two independent notes by Guinier and Preston were published in the journal Nature, followed by more substantial presentations by these authors. They showed by hue or oscillating-crystal x-ray diffraction that the hardening was due to the formation of a new phase, which was later identified as GP zones. This discovery led to a deeper understanding of the age-hardening process in aluminum alloys."

        "output": "The analysis reveals that RSP significantly influences the microstructure and properties of tool steels. For fast quenches and solute-rich steels, austenite is retained, while at intermediate quench rates, austenite is the primary phase. At conventional cooling rates, martensite dominates. The kinetics of hardening during heat-treatment are minimally affected, but the pattern of carbide precipitation is refined, and carbide segregation is minimized. The peak hardness is increased for optimal treatments. The martensitic transformation is also modified by RSP, as observed by Inokuti and Cantor [1976]."

The Ms temperature on cooling decreases with rapid quenching, but this effect is not reversible on repeated cycling between α and γ phases. A prolonged γ anneal is required to restore the normal behavior of the alloy. The α → γ start temperatures on reheating also show a decrease with rapid quenching, indicating a structural change in the austenite phase."

        "output": "The relationship between austenite grain size and Ms in Fe-Ni-C alloys is influenced by RSP and thermal cycling. RSP leads to a drop in Ms of 200 K for Fe-17% Ni due to the fine austenite grains (d = 4-5 μm). Thermal cycling, via the reverse shear transformation, restores the fine austenite grains, while a long γ anneal allows for substantial austenite grain growth. The growth of austenite grains is often sluggish in RSP steels due to stable, extremely fine sulphide dispersions at austenite grain boundaries. A slight reduction in cooling rate can result in massive transformation instead of martensite."

This homogeneity allows for easy hot-working and, in extreme cases, superplastic forming. Additionally, melt-spinning promotes uniformity of structure throughout a large piece, which can lead to improved mechanical properties. The microstructure of melt-spun superalloys has been examined in detail, showing imperfect ordering with smaller antiphase domains compared to gas atomization. This change in microstructure can result in enhanced performance and increased cooling rates, making melt-spinning a preferred method for producing high-quality superalloys."

However, the RSP process has a major problem, as the fine grain sizes produced make the alloy very liable to creep at high temperatures but low stresses. This issue can be overcome by a process of directional recrystallization of the RSP alloy after it has been consolidated and formed, which involves a slow passage through a steep thermal gradient."

As supernucleation continues, the largest nuclei will form (i) at times when S is decreasing and r* is increasing; (ii) when r*(t) is increasing even though T could be increasing initially as the supersaturation limit is not yet reached in some sites; in most cases, especially before growth stops, there are nucleation conditions allowing the formation of larger nuclei.\n\n[Note: This instruction aims to understand the behavior of supersaturated alloys and the formation of nuclei.

This value is relatively high compared to the JMAK model, showcasing the grain boundary obstacles.\n\n- The activation energy for grain boundary barrier collapse is estimated to be around 1.8 eV, compared to conventional ceramic inclusions or precipitations.

The interstitial solute's activity coefficient will alter the specific interfacial energy between the cell wall and the interstitial solute, making it more difficult for the recrystallization process to occur, thus inducing stasis.\n\n2.

Chadwick)\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to talk to you today about one of the most fascinating areas of research in the metallurgical field: phase transformations. As we all know, phase transformations refer to changes in the microstructure of metals that occur when the crystal structure changes, leading to new physical and mechanical properties. In 1970, I was fortunate to contribute to a discussion of phase transformations at the International Steel Conference, held at ASME in New York City. We discussed the importance of understanding phase transformations in the steel industry, with applications in steel production, repair, and analysis. These transformations play a crucial role in determining the mechanical properties and long-term behavior of steel alloys. In this year of 1970, our work on phase transformations was recognized and appreciated by our international community. Thank you for your attention, and I hope this brief summary has given you a glimpse into our research on phase transformations.\"\n\n**Output (in a post conference Q&A session):**\n\nQ: Dr. Chadwick, what was the significance of phase transformations in the steel industry?\nA: Phase transformations allowed us to understand the mechanical properties of metals and develop new techniques for improving steel alloys.\n\nQ: You mentioned the International Steel Conference in 1970. Can you tell us more about that?\nA: Yes, it was a conference that brought together experts from around the world to discuss phase transformations in metals and alloys. I was honored to share my work with the audience.\n\nQ: What led to your research on phase transformations?\nA: I was inspired by the books \"The Metallography of Phase Transformation\" by Dr. G. A. Chadwick, \"Order-Disorder Transformations in Solids\" by H. Warlimont, and \"The Theory of Transformation in Metals and Alloys\" by J. W. Christian. These books sparked my interest in the study of phase transformations.\n\nQ: Will researchers continue to study phase transformations in the steel industry?\nA: Absolutely. With advancements in technology and better understanding of phase transformations, researchers will likely continue to investigate their applications in steel production and analysis."

Plate-shaped PFTs are characterized by a localized distortion of the lattice structure accompanied by shear stress relief and disorder.\n\n**Shearing effects:** Shear stress acts as a stress concentrate, promoting the migration of lattice dislocations through the precipitated particles. This results in the formation of a plate-like microstructure with enhanced lattice ordering and reduced dislocation density.\n\n**Diffusion effects:** Diffusion of solute atoms through the precipitated particles introduces new lattice defects and textures, leading to increased dislocations and a more amorphous microstructure. This diffusive transformation weakens the overall mechanical properties of the alloy.\n\n**Importance of understanding shear and diffusion:** The accurate understanding of shear and diffusion mechanisms is essential in predicting the properties of PFTs, including their texture, microstrain, and mechanical strength. This knowledge can inform alloy design and optimization strategies for precipitation hardening applications.\n\n**Conclusion:** Comprehensive understanding of the role of shear and diffusion in PFTs provides valuable insights into the complex relationships between mechanical properties, microstructure, and alloy kinetics."

The presence of dislocations within the martensite crystal lattice allows for specific deformation mechanisms, such as slip and twinning, which can generate significant elastic strain in the material.\n\nOne key theoretical framework that helps predict the behavior of martensite during deformation is the concept of Bain strain. This theory describes the resulting lattice deformation that occurs under specific conditions of plastic strain, distinguishing it from lower-order deformation mechanisms. By understanding the relationship between the Bain strain and the rigid body rotation undergone by the martensite lattice, it is possible to accurately determine the net lattice deformation resulting from the deformation process.\n\nFurthermore, the determination of the habit plane in martensite exhibits characteristics that are not typically associated with rational indices. Instead, a purely elastic deformation approach, reconciling with the macroscopic nature of the deformation, enables the calculation of a substructure consisting of both twin planes and slip steps, providing insights into the underlying mechanics of twinning and slip movement.\n\nAs a result, the martensite theoretical framework enables the prediction of an invariant-plane strain content that characterizes the resulting macroscopic deformation of the material. This invariance of strain under deformation is a crucial requirement for understanding and describing the observed shape deformation in steels. By understanding the underlying theoretical basis, such as the Bain strain relationship and its implications for substructure analysis, insights into the mechanics of coherent plastic deformation can be gained."
